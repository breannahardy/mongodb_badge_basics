## Written Response
One big difference between relational databases like MySQL and non-relational ones like MongoDB is how they organize data. MySQL uses tables with fixed columns and rows, while MongoDB stores data in a flexible format that doesn't need a set structure. Another difference is that MySQL is great for complex queries and consistent transactions, while MongoDB is better for handling large amounts of unstructured or changing data. In healthcare, I think MongoDB would work well for storing electronic health records that include different types of data like patient notes, images, and device readings, since it can easily adapt as new information is added.
